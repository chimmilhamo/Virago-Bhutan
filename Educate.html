    <h1> FEMINISM: All You Need to Know </h1>
  </br>
    <h2 class="one"> What is Feminism? </h2>
      <p> Majority of people think of feminism as a movement that is only for females, but that notion is wrong. It's much easier
        for us to say that feminism is about females. However, women empowerment is just a small part of the whole idea. Feminists
        actually strive to address many societal problems such as toxic masculinity, female rights, access to basic hygiene
        products that should be free, mental health issues in both the sexes, LGBT rights, etc. Feminists mainly want to bring down the
        suppression of women in society.</p>
        <p>According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, feminism is both an intellectual commitment
        and a political movement that seeks justice for women and the end of sexism in all forms. Feminism is about
        gender equality- it does not mean that men and women are the "same". Feminism is about equal rights and equal
        opportunities.  Men and women don't have to be the "same" physically to have the right to equality, feminism
        isn't about how men and women are the "same". It's about giving ALL PEOPLE equal rights. Feminism, in simple words,
        would mean "equal rights and opportunities for all genders". </p>
      <p>Bhutan is a small country and so, very few of us are well educated about what feminism is. There are still so many
        issues even in a city like Thimphu. People still don't get why we need rights or why we're fighting for this. They just blatantly
        assume that because we are feminists, we support females for no reason. That isn't true; we feminists support females where it is
        right and where we deserve rights. </p>
      </br>

    <h2 class="one"> Why Does Feminism Exist? </h2>
    <p> You may wonder why we say "feminism" and "woman empowerment" if we're going to desrcibe this cause as equality for
      ALL genders. While this may seem a bit unfair to men, we can not ignore the fact that women have always been oppressed since
      olden times. Women weren't allowed to have proper jobs or even education- people used to see women as housekeepers and providers
      of a family heir. What's worse is that even the women themselves believed that this was their only purpose. </p>
    <p> In the olden days, having a daughter was like a burden because it was believed that she would not bring any wealth and luck
      in the family. Raising a daughter was a waste of time, effort and money. Therefore daughters were looked down upon and were
      considered useless apart from doing the housework and providing children. </p>
    <p> Nowadays, even with the feminism movement going on, women have to work much harder than men to prove themselves capable
      and worthy. Women are still seen as objects, as assets that can be toyed and tampered with. It is important that we understand why
      the feminism movement exists: it is to put an end to all these inhumane views that people think are normal but aren't. </p>

      >History and Theory of Feminism</a>
    </br>
  </br>

    <h2 class="one"> Misconceptions and Misunderstandings </h2>
    <p> There is a reason why feminism is opposed by many. First of all, there are people (both men and women) who do NOT believe in gender
      equality or equal right for all genders. These people believe that men and women should not have equal rights. This goes two ways:
      those who believe MEN are superior and those who believe WOMEN are superior. Needless to say, these people are the reason why feminism
      exists in the first place. </p>
      <p> Another reason why the idea of feminism is being misunderstood and hated is because of people who claim to be feminists, but
        are actually oppressors who use feminism to drag men down. They are not feminists and they have completely twisted the very purpose
        of feminism. Because of these individuals and organizations that fight for SUPERIORITY and not EQUALITY, feminism is misunderstood. </p>
      </br>

      <p> Now that you know what exactly feminism means, let's go over some widely debated topics that you might want to know about. </p>
</br>
      <h2 class="two"> A MAN'S OPINION </h2>
      <p> There is no rule that only women can be feminists- even men can be feminists. After all, feminism is about gender equality. However,
        if a man voices is opinion over something that only women experience and go through (for example: teenage pregnancy), his opinion on the matter
        will not be respected if it is against those of the affected women. As right as he may think he is and no matter how good his intentions may be, he
        will never know the pain a woman has to deal with during situations like this and usually his opinion is disregarded and considered as "oppressive"
        and "talking over victims". If you haven't gone through it, you can not tell people it isn't a big deal. For women who go through hardships like this,
        a man's opinion on why "it's not a big deal" or "it shouldn't be a topic of discussion" is considered extremely disrespectful and insensitive.
       It is everyone's moral duty to learn to respect the feelings of these people and not make them feel invalid. </p>
     </br>

     <h2 class="two"> CAT-CALLING </h2>
     <p> Cat-calling is a crime, a form of sexual harassment. Most people don't know that, neither does the victim nor the person cat-calling them.
       Because this is so common all around the world, both men and women think it's not a big deal and continue to do nothing about it.
       It is actually a big crime and people have gone to jail for it. </p>
       <p> A woman's body is not an asset; no one has any right to publicly call and comment on her body like it's an item being auctioned.
      No one feels comfortable when they're being cat-called and mind you, this has absolutely nothing to do with what the person is wearing.
      Sure, you may think "oh, she was cat-called because she was wearing that short dress and tight crop-top. She asked for it." NO.
      There are young girls who were cat-called while they were in their school uniforms. Blaming the clothes doesn't sound so right now, does it?
    <p> Besides, a girl can wear whatever she wanst to wear. It is her body and she can show as much skin as she wants to. No one else has any right
      or justification to judge or comment on what she wears. Blaming a girl for the sexual harassment she goes through just because of her clothes
    is victim shaming. </p>
      <p> Of course, this doesn't apply to women only. Men's bodies aren't assets either; they aren't monuments for one to touch or comment on.
        Men being cat-called isn't very common, but that doesn't mean it's not happening. Regardless of your gender, you body is completely yours
        and no one should judge or comment on your choice of clothing. Regardless of your gender, cat-calling is a form of sexual harassment
        and must stop. </p>
